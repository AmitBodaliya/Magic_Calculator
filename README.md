# 🧮 Magic Calculator

**Magic Calculator** is an Android calculator app with a built-in mathematical trick that feels like magic.  
The app looks and behaves like a normal calculator (inspired by **Samsung One UI Calculator**), but it hides a clever logic that always produces a **pre-known result**.

This project was created as an experiment to combine **math tricks + Android development**.

## ✨ The Magic Trick Explained

The trick involves **three participants**:

### Step 1: First Participant  
- Enters **any 4-digit number** of their choice  
  - Example: `1234`, `2477`, `9081`, etc.

### Step 2: Second Participant  
- Enters **another 4-digit number** of their choice  
- Both numbers are completely free and not fixed

### Step 3: Third Participant (Blindfolded)  
- The third person’s **eyes are closed or blindfolded**
- When they start typing, the **system automatically generates** the required number
- This number is calculated internally by the app
- The third participant **does not know** what number is entered

## 🎩 The Result (Magic Part)

- Before starting the trick, the **magician already knows the final answer**
- After adding all three numbers:
  - The final sum **always matches the predicted result**
- To the audience, it feels like:
  > “The magician read your mind and predicted the calculation.”

The secret lies in **pre-calculated logic**, where:
- First two numbers are user-entered
- The third number is **auto-generated** to balance the equation
